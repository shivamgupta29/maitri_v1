Let's try 'Color Breathing'. Imagine a color that feels calming. As you breathe in, picture that color filling your body. As you breathe out, imagine a murky, gray color of fear leaving you.

Place a hand on your heart and feel its rhythm. Remind yourself, "In this moment, I am here, and I am okay." Repeat it a few times, syncing with your breath.
